1. Core Math Operations Module
This module contains basic mathematical operations required for SVM, such as dot product and vector operations.

Functions
Dot Product: Computes the dot product between two vectors.
Vector Addition: Adds two vectors together.
Scalar Multiplication: Multiplies a vector by a scalar.
Euclidean Norm: Computes the norm (length) of a vector.
Dependencies
No external dependencies; this module can be stand-alone.
2. Data Processing Module
This module handles the data representation and manipulation required for SVM. It should be able to import and export data, and possibly scale or normalize it.

Functions
Load Data: Reads data from a file or other source into memory.
Normalize Data: Scales data to a specified range or mean/standard deviation.
Shuffle Data: Shuffles data points for training randomness.
Split Data: Splits data into training and testing sets.
Dependencies
Depends on the core math operations module for normalization functions.
3. SVM Model Module
This module implements the SVM algorithm, including training and prediction.

Functions
Initialize Model: Initializes model parameters (weights and bias).
Train SVM: Trains the SVM with gradient descent or SMO.
Compute Gradient: Computes the gradient for weight/bias updates.
Predict: Predicts the class of a given data point based on the model.
Calculate Loss: Computes the loss function (e.g., hinge loss).
Dependencies
Depends on the core math operations module for dot product and vector operations.
Depends on the data processing module for input data.
4. SVM Utilities Module
This module contains utility functions that support the SVM operations, such as data transformation and I/O operations.

Functions
Save Model: Saves the SVM model to a file for later use.
Load Model: Loads a previously saved SVM model.
Calculate Accuracy: Computes the accuracy of the SVM on a given dataset.
Log Metrics: Logs training metrics such as loss and accuracy.
Dependencies
Depends on the SVM model module for model-related operations.
Depends on the data processing module for handling input/output operations.



Module Dependency Overview
Here's a quick overview of how the modules depend on each other:

Core Math Operations Module: Stand-alone, no dependencies.
Data Processing Module: Depends on Core Math Operations for data manipulation.
SVM Model Module: Depends on Core Math Operations for basic math, and on Data Processing for training data.
SVM Utilities Module: Depends on SVM Model for model-related tasks and on Data Processing for I/O and logging.
