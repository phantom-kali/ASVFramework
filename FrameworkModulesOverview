# SVM Framework Modules Overview

## 1. Core Math Operations Module
This module contains basic mathematical operations required for SVM, such as dot product and vector operations.

### Functions
- Dot Product: Computes the dot product between two vectors.
- Vector Addition: Adds two vectors together.
- Scalar Multiplication: Multiplies a vector by a scalar.
- Euclidean Norm: Computes the norm (length) of a vector.

### Dependencies
No external dependenciesâ€”it can be used as a stand-alone module.

## 2. Data Processing Module
This module handles the data representation and manipulation required for SVM: importing, exporting, normalizing, and splitting data.

### Functions
- Load Data: Reads data from a file/source into memory.
- Normalize Data: Scales data to a specified range or mean/standard deviation.
- Shuffle Data: Randomizes data points for training.
- Split Data: Divides data into training/testing sets.

### Dependencies
Depends on the Core Math Operations Module for normalization and vector operations.

## 3. SVM Model Module
Implements the SVM algorithm, including training and prediction logic.

### Functions
- Initialize Model: Initializes model parameters (weights/bias).
- Train SVM: Trains the SVM model (e.g., via gradient descent).
- Compute Gradient: Calculates gradients for updates.
- Predict: Predicts the class of a given data point.
- Calculate Loss: Computes the chosen loss function (e.g., hinge loss).

### Dependencies
- Core Math Operations for dot product and other math ops.
- Data Processing Module for training data handling.

## 4. SVM Utilities Module
Offers utility functions that support the SVM operations, such as logging and model persistence.

### Functions
- Save Model: Saves the SVM model parameters to a file.
- Load Model: Loads a previously saved model.
- Calculate Accuracy: Measures model accuracy on a dataset.
- Log Metrics: Logs training metrics (loss, accuracy, etc.).

### Dependencies
- SVM Model Module for model-related tasks.
- Data Processing Module for data I/O.

## Module Dependency Overview
- Core Math Operations: standalone.
- Data Processing: depends on Core Math for data manipulation.
- SVM Model: depends on Core Math for computations, Data Processing for input data.
- SVM Utilities: depends on SVM Model for model ops and Data Processing for I/O.
